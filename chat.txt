Example Workflow
Client Registration and Project Creation:

Client registers via Client Registration endpoint.
Client creates a project via Project Microservice's /projects endpoint.
Project Microservice notifies Admin for project approval.
Admin Project Approval and Purchase Order Request:

Admin views the project in the dashboard and approves it via Project Microservice's /projects/{id}/approve endpoint.
Admin generates a purchase order via Purchase Order Microservice's /purchase-orders endpoint.
Client Budget Submission:

Client receives the purchase order and submits budget details via Purchase Order Microservice's /purchase-orders/{id}/budget endpoint.
Purchase Order Microservice updates Finance Microservice with the budget details.
Invoice Generation and Download:

Invoice Microservice generates invoices for the project.
Client views and downloads project invoices via Invoice Microservice's /invoices/{id}/download endpoint.

Step 2: Open the Project in Your IDE
Open the Project:
Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) and import the extracted project.
Step 3: Configure application.properties
Open application.properties:
Navigate to application.properties.
Add the following configurations:
Step 4: Implement Basic CRUD Operations
Create the Employee Model:

Create a new file Employee.java in src/main/java/com/example/employee/model/:
Create the Employee Repository:

Create a new file EmployeeRepository.java in src/main/java/com/example/employee/repository/:
Create the Employee Service:

Create a new file EmployeeService.java in src/main/java/com/example/employee/service/:
Create the Employee Controller:

Create a new file EmployeeController.java in src/main/java/com/example/employee/controller/:
Step 5: Repeat for Other Microservices
Follow similar steps to create and configure the project-service, finance-service, purchase-order-service, and invoice-service with their respective responsibilities and dependencies.

Step 6: Implement Inter-Microservice Communication
Use Kafka for asynchronous event-driven communication.

Step 7: Test and Deploy
Write test cases for APIs using JUnit and Mockito.
Test Kafka producers and consumers.
Test the entire application using Postman or cURL.
Deploy microservices and Angular frontend.
MongoDB Setup Using VS Code Extension
Step 1: Install MongoDB Extension for VS Code
Open Visual Studio Code:
Launch Visual Studio Code.
Install MongoDB Extension:
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for "MongoDB" and install the "MongoDB for VS Code" extension by MongoDB.
Step 2: Connect to MongoDB
Open the MongoDB Extension:
Click on the MongoDB icon in the Activity Bar to open the MongoDB extension.
Add a Connection:
Click on the "Connect" button.
In the "Connection String" field, enter your MongoDB connection string. For a local MongoDB instance, it would be:
Click "Connect".
Step 3: Create a Database and Collection
Create a Database:
In the MongoDB extension view, right-click on your connection and select "Create Database".
Enter the database name as employee_db.
Create a Collection:
Right-click on the employee_db database and select "Create Collection".
Enter the collection name as employees.
Step 4: Insert and Query Data
Insert Data:
Right-click on the employees collection and select "Insert Document".
Enter the following JSON document and click "Insert":
Query Data:
Right-click on the employees collection and select "Find Documents".
This will open a new editor tab with the query results.
Step 5: Configure Spring Boot to Connect to MongoDB
Add MongoDB Dependency:
Ensure you have the MongoDB dependency in your pom.xml:
Configure MongoDB Connection:
Open application.properties and add the MongoDB connection details:
Step 6: Verify MongoDB Connection
Run the Application:
Start your Spring Boot application and ensure it connects to MongoDB without errors.
Insert and Retrieve Data:
Use the Employee Service and Controller to insert and retrieve data from the MongoDB database.

GitHub Copilot
Sure, let's continue from where we left off. We were updating the ProjectService to handle the project approval and connect to the finance-service using WebClient.

Step 1: Update ProjectService
Add the WebClient to the ProjectService and update the approveProject method:

Step 2: Update ProjectController
Ensure the ProjectController calls the approveProject method in the ProjectService:

Step 3: Update FinanceController in finance-service
Ensure the FinanceController has an endpoint to handle the approval request:

Step 4: Test the Endpoint
After making the necessary changes, test the approveProject endpoint again:

Request:

Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:8080/projects/101/approve
Response:

Status: 200 OK
Make sure both the project-service and finance-service are running and accessible. 
The project-service should be able to call the finance-service to update the financial 
status of the project upon approval.
